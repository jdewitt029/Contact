<p style = "font-family: Lucida Grande; border-color: white; font-size: 30px;color: white;" border= "5"> 
	My name is Jordan DeWitt and I am currently attending San Jose State as a digital media art major. <br> I am 22 years old and I love anime, sports, and video games. A lot of my work is usually inspired <br> by anime. I really enjoy anime, so my work is almost like a tribute to anime. I want to show how I <br>  feel when I watch anime through my work. I am also going to be opening up a side business with a <br> couple of my friends for making customized posters for people. We are called No Ceiling Media and if you <br> could follow our IG below that would be much appreciated.  </p>
